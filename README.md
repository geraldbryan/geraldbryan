## 👋 Hey there, welcome to my GitHub!  

I'm passionate about **data visualization** and love exploring how data can drive business decisions. There’s something exciting about turning raw numbers into insights that make an impact! 📊✨. 

I'm a **lifelong learner**, always curious about new things—so if you ever want to chat about tech, data, or just life in general, I'm all ears! 🎙️. 

Also, I'm really into **the financial markets**, especially the **Indonesian stock market**. If you're into investing, let’s exchange thoughts and strategies! 📈💰  

Big fan of **AI and its endless possibilities**, always keen to explore new advancements in the field. And when I’m not diving into data or AI, you’ll probably find me watching football—because, well, I’ve been a **football fan for ages**. Watching a game together sounds like a great idea! ⚽🔥  

Feel free to connect—let’s talk, collaborate, or just geek out over common interests! 🚀
